## Data sets and Questions 

The Enron fraud is a big, messy and totally fascinating story about corporate malfeasance of nearly every imaginable type. The Enron email and financial datasets are also big, messy treasure troves of information, which become much more useful once you know your way around them a bit. Find out about the Enron data set in the [`explore_enron_data`](https://github.com/AnaHristian/intro_to_machine_learning/blob/master/explore_enron_data.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. 

### Enron story

* The largest case of corporate fraud in American history: the Enron Corpus with real emails
* Use it to to try to figure out if there are patterns within the emails of people who were persons of interest in the fraud case to see if you can identify those patterns
* Using regressions: understand the relationship between the salaries of the people in Enron and their bonuses
* Clustering on the data (type of unsupervised learning): who within this organization was a member of the board of directors and who was just a regular employee
  * Example: in netflix they use it to identify particular types of people by their movie choices (clusters of users)
* Outlier detection and removal to find certain lines in the data set that were bugs basically, clean out manually

### Person of Interest (POI)
* Indicted
* Settled without admitting guilt
* Testified in exchange for immunity

## Regression

Use regression to predict financial data for Enron employees and associates in the [`regressions_enron_data`](https://github.com/AnaHristian/intro_to_machine_learning/blob/master/regressions_enron_data.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.
